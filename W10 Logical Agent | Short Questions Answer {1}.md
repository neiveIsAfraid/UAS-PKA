### Part 2: Model Answers

1.  **Core Concept:** The architecture is amenable to the knowledge level because the agent's behavior can be specified solely by detailing **what the agent knows** and **what its goals are**, without needing to specify the specific procedural implementation details (linked lists, registers, etc.).
2.  **Core Concept:** If an inference algorithm is sound but incomplete, it means that while every conclusion it draws is logically correct, there may exist true sentences that are **are entailed by the KB** but **cannot be derived** using that algorithm.
3.  **Core Concept:** Entailment means that a sentence $\alpha$ is true in **all possible worlds (models)** in which the KB is true. **Model checking** is the process of explicitly enumerating all relevant models to verify this condition (i.e., checking that the set of models satisfying KB is a subset of the models satisfying $\alpha$).
4.  **Core Concept:** Resolution is a **single inference rule** which, when coupled with a complete search algorithm, is guaranteed to find a proof for any entailed sentence, provided the KB is expressed in **Conjunctive Normal Form (CNF)**.
5.  **Core Concept:** **Forward chaining** is **data-driven**, starting with known facts and deriving conclusions until the query is reached. **Backward chaining** is **goal-directed**, starting with the query and working backward to find premises. Backward chaining is preferred for answering specific questions, as it only touches relevant facts.
6.  **Core Concept:** Propositional logic lacks the **expressive power** to deal concisely with universal patterns of relationships among **objects** over **time and space**. Representing such domains requires an unmanageably large number of sentences or axioms.
7.  **Core Concept:** The unit clause heuristic identifies a clause with only one unassigned literal, forcing the assignment of a value to that symbol. This assignment can **propagate unit clauses** throughout the knowledge base, potentially solving large parts of the problem without additional branching, similar to constraint propagation in CSPs.
8.  **Core Concept:** Successor-state axioms are logical formulas that specify the necessary and sufficient conditions for a **fluent** (a changing aspect of the world) to be true at time $t+1$. This allows the agent to update its belief about the world state simply by inferring the truth values of fluents based on the previous state and the action taken.
9.  **Core Concept:** The **declarative approach** involves constructing a system by simply **TELLing** the agent sentences one by one. In contrast, the **procedural approach** encodes desired behaviors directly into the program structure, making knowledge difficult to modify or inspect.
10. **Core Concept:** Searching for a proof can be more efficient because the process can **ignore irrelevant propositions**. However, propositional theorem proving (using resolution or truth table enumeration) is **co-NP-complete** in the worst case, meaning that no known algorithm is polynomially faster than model checking.

**Chapter 8: First-Order Logic**

11. **Core Concept:** FOL makes an ontological commitment not just to facts, but also to **objects and relations**. This allows universal rules and patterns to be represented concisely using quantifiers, avoiding the need for massive lists of individual facts required by propositional logic.
12. **Core Concept:** Function symbols allow the representation of **complex objects** using expressions that refer to a single object, such as $\text{LeftLeg}(\text{John})$. This prevents having to name every object individually, thus further extending the expressiveness and conciseness of the language.
13. **Core Concept:** The use of **implication ($\Rightarrow$)** means that the assertion is true whenever its antecedent ($\text{King}(x)$) is false. Since a crown is not a king, the premise is false, and the implication is vacuously true, saying nothing about the personhood of the crown.
14. **Core Concept:** A simple True/False response confirms only existence ($\exists x \text{Person}(x)$). The substitution list ($\{x/\text{John}\}, \{x/\text{Richard}\}$) provides the **specific objects** that satisfy the query, making the answer actionable and informative, similar to a database query result.
15. **Core Concept:** The **ontology** defines the **vocabulary**—the set of predicates, functions, and constants—that represent the domain concepts. A well-chosen ontology is essential because it determines how knowledge can be encoded and the types of general rules that can be expressed.
16. **Core Concept:** FOL can use the **universal quantifier ($\forall$) over time $t$** within successor-state axioms. This means only one general axiom is required for a predicate regardless of the number of time steps, whereas propositional logic requires a separate copy of the axiom for each time step.
17. **Core Concept:** An **axiom** is a sentence taken as being given without being derived from other sentences in the KB. A **theorem** is a sentence that is **entailed by the axioms** and can be logically derived from them.
18. **Core Concept:** Database semantics assumes the **unique-names assumption** (constants refer to distinct objects) and the **closed-world assumption** (atomic sentences not known true are false). These assumptions ensure a **finite set of possible worlds**, making inference computationally tractable for database systems.
19. **Core Concept:** Terms allow FOL to specify **which objects** are related in an atomic sentence through their positions, whereas propositional logic symbols are atomic facts that cannot be broken down to refer to objects or relations.
20. **Core Concept:** Adding a theorem to the KB can significantly **reduce the computational cost** of deriving new sentences. Instead of having to derive the conclusion from first principles (axioms) every time, the reasoning system can use the pre-established theorem as an intermediate step.

**Chapter 9: Inference in First-Order Logic**

21. **Core Concept:** Propositionalization works by substituting ground terms for quantified variables. If the KB includes **function symbols** (e.g., $\text{Father}(\text{John})$), the set of possible ground terms that can be generated is potentially **infinite**, making exhaustive propositional inference impossible.
22. **Core Concept:** Unification finds the single **substitution $\theta$** needed to make the premises of the rule exactly match the facts in the KB. Lifted inference avoids creating the vast number of irrelevant, explicit ground sentences required by propositionalization, leading to greater efficiency.
23. **Core Concept:** Semidecidability means that while algorithms (like resolution) exist that can confirm every entailed sentence, **no algorithm exists** that can definitively confirm all sentences that are *not* entailed.
24. **Core Concept:** Entailment is proven through **proof by contradiction** (refutation completeness). The algorithm proves that the set of sentences $\text{KB} \land \neg \alpha$ is **unsatisfiable** by repeatedly applying resolution until the **empty clause** (representing a contradiction) is derived.
25. **Core Concept:** Datalog KBs contain no function symbols, which guarantees that only a **finite number** of distinct ground facts can be generated. Because the set of facts is finite, the forward chaining algorithm must eventually reach a fixed point where no new facts can be added, ensuring completeness.
26. **Core Concept:** Backward chaining is **goal-directed**, meaning it starts with the query and recursively breaks it down into subgoals, pursuing only those facts and rules that are relevant to answering the initial question. This selectivity often makes the process much more efficient than forward chaining, which may generate many irrelevant conclusions.
27. **Core Concept:** Skolemization is used to eliminate **existential quantifiers ($\exists$)**. It replaces existentially quantified variables with either **Skolem constants** or **Skolem functions** to ensure the resulting sentence remains satisfiable (maintaining inferential equivalence) while being purely universally quantified.
28. **Core Concept:** Prolog uses the **closed world assumption**, meaning any sentence not proven true is assumed false, and the **unique names assumption**. These assumptions simplify the model and enable efficient, deterministic query answering, but they violate the standard model-theoretic semantics of pure FOL, limiting expressiveness.
29. **Core Concept:** The search strategy that mirrors backward chaining on Horn clauses is **input resolution**. This strategy resolves the current clause against an original input sentence (from the KB or negated query), resulting in a characteristic "spine-like" proof tree structure.
30. **Core Concept:** Demodulation takes a unit clause $x=y$ and uses it as a **simplification rule** to substitute $y$ for $x$ in other clauses. This is more efficient than axiomatizing equality, which requires generating many substitution axioms that often lead to unhelpful conclusions during general inference.
