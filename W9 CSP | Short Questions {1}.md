### Part 1: The Questions

1.  Why is treating a problem as a Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP) generally more efficient than using an atomic state-space search method (Chapter 3) on the same problem?
2.  How does the application of constraint propagation mechanisms, such as arc consistency (AC-3), fundamentally contribute to solving CSPs without performing extensive search?
3.  What is the primary implication of the commutativity property in CSPs regarding the structure and complexity of the backtracking search space?
4.  Explain the strategic advantage of using the least-constraining-value heuristic during variable assignment in a CSP search.
5.  When a local search algorithm employs the min-conflicts heuristic, why does its success on problems like N-queens suggest that the solutions are densely distributed in the state space?
6.  How does the structural property of a tree-structured constraint graph allow for the CSP to be solved in time linear in the number of variables, and what algorithm exploits this?
7.  In constraint propagation, why are special-purpose inference algorithms for global constraints (like *Alldiff*) sometimes more effective than translating those constraints purely into equivalent binary constraints?
8.  What is the computational tradeoff when utilizing cutset conditioning, specifically comparing the size of the chosen cycle cutset ($c$) against the overall complexity?
