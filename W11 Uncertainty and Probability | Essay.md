Based on Chapter 12, "Quantifying Uncertainty," here are 5 complex essay questions that require critical analysis:

1.  Critically evaluate the inherent limitations of purely logical agents when attempting to operate in real-world, non-deterministic, and partially observable environments, specifically addressing the **logical qualification problem**. Explain how **probability theory** (Section 12.1) provides a foundational shift that enables rational action by summarizing uncertainty stemming from factors such as **laziness** and **theoretical ignorance**, thereby solving the qualification problem.

2.  The full joint probability distribution (Section 12.3) offers a theoretically complete knowledge base for probabilistic inference. Analyse the critical challenge of **scalability** inherent in the full joint distribution for realistic problems involving numerous variables (e.g., $n=100$). Discuss how the mathematical concepts of **absolute independence** and, more centrally, **conditional independence** (Sections 12.4 and 12.5) serve as essential mechanisms for decomposing and factoring this intractable representation into manageable conditional distributions.

3.  Discuss the principle of **maximizing expected utility** (MEU) as the core definition of rational decision-making in uncertain domains. Explain why, in complex scenarios where no plan is guaranteed to achieve the goal, maximizing the probability of success is insufficient, necessitating the integration of **beliefs** (probabilities) and **desires** (utility) to determine the best course of action.

4.  The **Naive Bayes model** (Section 12.6) is widely used for classification tasks despite explicitly assuming the conditional independence of all effect variables given the cause. Critically analyze the consequences of frequently violating this fundamental independence assumption in practice, such as the model exhibiting **overconfidence**. Justify why, despite these theoretical errors, the Naive Bayes model often performs successfully in applications requiring the ranking of possible outcomes, rather than precise probability values.

5.  Examine the utility of probabilistic inference over purely logical deduction in determining an agent's actions within partially observable environments, using the **Wumpus World revisited** (Section 12.7) as an illustrative example. Explain how a probabilistic agent can leverage partial evidence (like a breeze) and **conditional independence** relationships to calculate the numerical likelihood of unseen dangers (like a pit in square $$), and discuss why this capability is crucial for making informed decisions when a logical agent would otherwise be forced to choose randomly.
