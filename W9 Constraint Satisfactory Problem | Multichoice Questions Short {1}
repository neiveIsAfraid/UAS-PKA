**Question 1**
What is the representation of a state used in a Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP)?
A. A single, atomic, indivisible entity.
B. A factored representation consisting of a set of variables, each with a value.
C. A set of actions that lead from the initial state to the goal state.
D. A probability distribution over possible outcomes.

**Question 2**
In the context of a CSP, what does a constraint graph represent?
A. The flow of control between different constraints in the solving algorithm.
B. The connections between variables that participate in at least one constraint.
C. The sequence of actions that transform the initial assignment into a complete solution.
D. The hierarchy of variable domains from most restricted to least restricted.

**Question 3**
Which of the following is cited as a major benefit of formulating a problem as a CSP compared to using an atomic state-space searcher?
A. CSP solvers inherently find the globally optimal solution without heuristics.
B. CSP solvers require domain-specific code for defining transitions.
C. A CSP solver can quickly prune large portions of the search space by identifying combinations that violate constraints.
D. CSPs reduce the search space complexity from $d^n$ to $n \cdot d$.

**Question 4**

A. Binary constraint
B. Global constraint
C. Unary constraint
D. Preference constraint

**Question 5**
The *Alldiff* constraint used in problems like Cryptarithmetic, which involves an arbitrary number of variables, is a prime example of which type of constraint?
A. Unary constraint
B. Binary constraint
C. Preference constraint
D. Global constraint

**Question 6**
Any CSP that involves arbitrary n-ary constraints can be systematically transformed into a binary CSP by:
A. Applying the Min-Conflicts heuristic iteratively.
B. Using the notion of $k$-consistency, where $k$ is the number of variables.
C. Introducing enough auxiliary variables to reduce constraints to sets of binary constraints.
D. Utilizing the constraint hypergraph structure to eliminate excess variables.

B. Global consistency (n-consistency).
C. Arc consistency (2-consistency).
D. K-consistency for all $k>2$.

**Question 8**
In the AC-3 algorithm, what action signals that no solution exists for the CSP?
A. When the queue of arcs becomes empty.
B. When the size of a variable's domain is reduced to zero.
C. When the algorithm must revise the domain of a variable $X_i$.
D. When the initial assignment is found to be incomplete.

**Question 9**
What is a **binary CSP**?
A. A CSP where variables can only take on values of 0 or 1.
B. A CSP where constraints can be satisfied or unsatisfied.
C. A CSP defined only by unary and binary constraints.
D. A CSP that requires exactly two distinct colors for a solution, such as in map coloring.

**Question 10**
Backtracking search capitalizes on which property of CSPs to significantly reduce the search space compared to a standard depth-limited search on partial assignments?
A. Linearity, meaning the complexity scales linearly with the number of variables.
B. NP-completeness, allowing for efficient pruning.
C. Commutativity, meaning the order of actions (variable assignments) does not affect the final outcome.
D. Completeness, ensuring a solution will be found if one exists.

**Question 11**
In local search algorithms for CSPs, the **min-conflicts heuristic** works by iteratively selecting a conflicted variable and reassigning it a value that:
A. Maximizes the size of the variable's domain.
B. Minimizes the number of violated constraints.
C. Maximizes the number of consistent neighboring variables.
D. Leads to the deepest possible assignment without immediate failure.

**Question 12**
What empirical observation was made regarding the performance of the min-conflicts algorithm on the $N$-queens problem (for large $N$)?
A. The algorithm consistently fails to find a solution in a reasonable time.
B. The run time, excluding the initial placement, is roughly linear in $N$.
C. The run time is roughly independent of the problem size, solving the million-queens problem in about 50 steps.
D. The algorithm only works for small values of $N$, typically $N \le 100$.

**Question 13**
How efficient is the deterministic algorithm, **TREE-CSP-SOLVER**, for solving CSPs whose constraint graph is a tree?
A. Polynomial time, dependent on the square of the number of variables ($O(n^2)$).
B. Exponential time, dependent on the depth of the tree.
C. Linear time in the number of variables.
D. It performs equivalently to standard backtracking search.

**Question 14**
What is a **cycle cutset** ($S$) in the context of solving CSPs by exploiting problem structure?
A. A subset of variables that contains all the constraints in the problem.
B. A subset of variables whose removal leaves the constraint graph as a tree.
C. A subset of domain values that are inconsistent with all constraints.
D. The set of variables involved in the most conflicting constraints.

**Question 15**
In the cutset conditioning algorithm, if the cycle cutset has size $c$ and the total number of variables is $n$, the total run time is estimated as proportional to $O(d^c \cdot (n-c)d^2)$. What does the term $d^c$ represent?
A. The complexity of solving the resulting tree problem.
B. The exponential cost of trying every possible assignment to the variables in the cycle cutset.
C. The size of the largest variable domain.
D. The maximum number of nodes visited in the tree decomposition.
