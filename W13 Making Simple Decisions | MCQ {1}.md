B) Maximizing the probability of reaching a goal state.\
C) Maximizing the expected utility (MEU) of the action outcomes.\
D) Satisfying all transitive preferences.

**Question 2**\
In decision theory, what is the term used to describe the set of uncertain possible outcomes resulting from an action?\
A) Contingency\
B) Lottery\
C) Preference Elicitation\
D) Stochastic Dominance

**Question 3**\
Which constraint (axiom of utility theory) dictates that if an agent prefers A to B and B to C, it must also prefer A to C?\
A) Substitutability\
B) Orderability\
C) Continuity\
D) Transitivity

**Question 4**\
What type of node is used in a Decision Network (Influence Diagram) to explicitly represent the agent's choice of action?\
A) Chance node (oval)\
B) Decision node (rectangle)\
C) Utility node (diamond)\
D) Evidence node (circle)

**Question 5**\
What is the definition of **Stochastic Dominance** in the context of multiattribute utility theory?\
A) A situation where one option is superior on all relevant attributes.\
B) A preference relation where one uncertain option is demonstrably better than another regardless of the specific utility function, based on their cumulative probability distributions.\
C) The property that a utility function must be linear with respect to the amount of money involved.\
D) The act of making an immediate decision based on estimated utility rather than seeking further information.

**Question 6**\
What is the primary purpose of the **Utility Function U(s)** in decision theory?\
A) To assign a probability distribution over the possible state transitions.\
B) To compute the total cost of acquiring evidence.\
C) To assign a single numerical value representing the desirability of a state.\
D) To quantify the agent's degree of belief in a given state.

**Question 7**\
Which property holds true for the **Expected Value of Information (VPI)**, according to a theorem derived from its definition?\
A) VPI is always negative, representing a cost incurred.\
B) VPI is guaranteed to converge to the utility of the optimal action.\
C) VPI is always non-negative.\
D) VPI equals the cost of the optimal action sequence.

**Question 8**\
The term **"predictably irrational"** is often used in descriptive theories of human judgment. What contrast does this term highlight?\
A) The contrast between observed human behavior and the expected behavior described by normative theory.\
B) The contrast between expected utility and immediate, realized utility.\
C) The contrast between deterministic outcomes and uncertain outcomes.\
D) The contrast between single-attribute and multiattribute utility functions.

**Question 9**\
When evaluating a Decision Network, what type of node behaves exactly like a chance node that has been set as an evidence variable after the agent commits to an action?\
A) Utility node\
B) Chance node\
C) Decision node\
D) Policy node

**Question 10**\
Which effect is described when the exact wording (e.g., "90% survival rate" versus "10% death rate") of a decision problem significantly impacts an agent's choices?\
A) Ambiguity aversion\
B) Anchoring effect\
C) Stochastic dominance\
D) Framing effect

**Question 11**\
What is the fundamental difference between a **normative theory** and a **descriptive theory** of decision-making?\
A) Normative theory describes how actual agents act, while descriptive theory describes how a rational agent should act.\
B) Normative theory describes how a rational agent should act, while descriptive theory describes how actual agents really do act.\
C) Normative theory applies only to continuous variables, while descriptive theory applies only to discrete variables.\
D) Descriptive theory uses probabilities, while normative theory uses logic.

**Question 12**\
What does the **Value of Information (VPI)** specifically measure?\
A) The expected cost of gathering information before making a decision.\
B) The maximum amount an agent should be willing to pay for information, defined as the expected gain in utility resulting from having the information before acting.\
C) The actual utility gained after successfully acquiring and using new evidence.\
D) The marginal probability of observing a new piece of evidence $E_j$.

**Question 13**\
In the context of decision networks, what is the graphical symbol used to represent a **utility node**?\
A) Oval\
B) Rectangle\
C) Diamond\
D) Circle

**Question 14**\
Which important property of sensing actions is highlighted by the fact that the total VPI gained from a sequence of observations is independent of the order in which they are performed?\
A) Order dependence\
B) Order independence\
C) Stochastic stability\
D) Myopic information gathering

**Question 15**\
What primary incentive causes a robot operating under uncertainty about a human's preferences to choose to **defer** to the human (e.g., allow itself to be switched off)?\
A) The human is guaranteed to be more rational than the robot.\
B) Deference costs the robot less computation time.\
C) The robot's uncertainty creates a positive expected gain in utility from receiving information about the human's true, underlying preferences.\
D) The action of being switched off has a guaranteed utility of zero.
