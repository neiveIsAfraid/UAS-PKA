### Part 1: The Questions

1.  What is the essential implication of an agent's adoption of the **maximum expected utility (MEU)** principle for its decision-making process, especially concerning the concept of "global" versus "local" rationality?
2.  Why does probability theory offer a superior solution to the **logical qualification problem** compared to purely logical approaches when defining rules for action in complex environments?
3.  How does the definition of probability as a measure relative to a **knowledge state** resolve the apparent paradox that a probability statement (e.g., P(cavity)=0.8) can be made about a patient who either definitively has or definitively does not have a cavity?
4.  Explain the computational challenge posed by the **full joint distribution** and how the concept of **independence** addresses this limitation in probabilistic representation.
5.  What is the practical utility of **Bayes' Rule** when performing inference in judgmental domains like medical diagnosis?
6.  How does the **Naive Bayes model** exploit conditional independence to maintain computational tractability, and what is the typical negative consequence of the necessary assumptions this model employs?
7.  In the revisited Wumpus World example, what critical decision-making capability does the probabilistic agent gain over the purely logical agent in uncertain situations (e.g., encountering a breeze)?
8.  Why is the calculation of **P(cause | effect)** often computationally more challenging than the calculation of **P(effect | cause)**, making Bayes' Rule a necessary tool for diagnostic reasoning?
9.  If an agent's degrees of belief violate the axioms of probability, what is the consequence, according to the sources' economic argument?
10. When calculating the conditional probability $\text{P}(X |e)$ using the full joint distribution (Equation 12.9), what role does the **unobserved (hidden) variables Y** play in the necessary summation and normalization?
