**Chapter 15: Making Simple Decisions**

1.  Critically analyze the trade-offs inherent in building concise Bayesian network representations by adhering to a **causal ordering** (causes precede effects). Explain how specifying parameters (Conditional Probability Tables, or CPTs) based on causal influence not only promotes network **compactness** but also simplifies the judgment tasks required of domain experts, and discuss the implication of choosing a poor (diagnostic) ordering instead.
2.  The task of general probabilistic inference in Bayesian networks is characterized as being **\#P-hard**. Explain what this complexity classification implies for the feasibility of using **Exact Inference** algorithms, such as **Variable Elimination**, in large, realistic networks. Furthermore, discuss how the algorithm's complexity relates directly to the size of the intermediate factors it constructs, and how this size is constrained by the network's topology.
3.  Compare the mechanisms of **Rejection Sampling** and **Likelihood Weighting** in performing approximate inference, particularly focusing on their effectiveness when the probability of the evidence $P(e)$ is vanishingly small. Explain why Likelihood Weighting often significantly outperforms Rejection Sampling in complex scenarios, and detail the structural mechanism (Likelihood Weighting's fixing of evidence variables) that enables this efficiency.
4.  Analyze the role and impact of **canonical distributions**, such as **Noisy-OR**, in managing the parameter complexity of Bayesian networks. Discuss how these models achieve an exponential reduction in the required number of parameters (from $O(2^k)$ to $O(k)$), and critically evaluate the effect of the independence assumptions embedded within these models on the overall representational accuracy of the system.
5.  Explain the conceptual and formal distinction between a **passive observation** (conditioning on evidence) and an **external intervention** (using the **do-operator**) in a **Causal Network**. Discuss how the network's semantics formally model an intervention by creating a "mutilated model" and explain why this capability is essential for answering questions about the effects of policy or action, which traditional conditional probability cannot address.
