B. It ensures that the full joint distribution can be expressed using only Bayes' rule.\

C. To compute the full joint distribution from a naive Bayes model.\
D. To prove the consistency of an agent's beliefs.

**Question 8**\
What is the philosophical meaning of a probability statement (e.g., P(cavity)=0.8), given that in the real world the patient either has a cavity or does not?\
A. It is an objective truth about the universe.\
B. It is made with respect to a **knowledge state**.\
C. It means the agent is being irrational.\
D. It describes the percentage of the time that the statement has been true historically.

**Question 9**\
In the context of the dental diagnosis example, which fundamental problem of logical approaches does probability theory solve by summarizing arbitrary unlikely contingencies?\
A. The inference problem.\
B. The monotonicity problem.\
C. The logical qualification problem.\

A. That all variables are logically independent of each other.\
B. That the full joint distribution is linear in the number of variables.\
C. That all **effect variables are conditionally independent given the single cause variable**.\
D. That all variables are Boolean.

**Question 11**\
When using Bayes' Rule to calculate the posterior probability P(cause | effect) for each possible cause, what general technique is often used to ensure the final probabilities sum to one?\
A. Summing over all hidden variables.\
B. Normalizing the results.\
C. Applying the unique names assumption.\
D. Ignoring all prior probabilities.

**Question 12**\
If an agent's degrees of belief do not conform to the axioms of probability, what argument suggests that the agent will be vulnerable to losing money over the long run?\
A. The principle of Occam's Razor.\
B. The existence of a **Dutch book** (a set of bets that guarantees a loss).\
C. The definition of completeness for inference.\
D. The logical qualification problem.

**Question 13**\
How is the rational decision-making principle of maximizing expected utility related to the definition of rationality?\
A. It provides a "global" definition of rationality that is impossible to satisfy.\
B. It turns the "global" definition of rationality (highest performance) into a "local" constraint on rational-agent designs.\
C. It applies only to sequential decision problems.\
D. It requires the agent to be perfectly rational in all situations.

**Question 14**\
When computing the conditional probability $P(X|e)$ using the full joint distribution, what variables must be summed out (marginalized over)?\
A. The evidence variables $E$.\
B. The query variable $X$.\
C. The **unobserved (hidden) variables $Y$**.\
D. All variables that are absolutely independent of $X$.

**Question 15**\
In the **Wumpus World**, why does the probabilistic approach enable the agent to make better decisions than a purely logical agent in uncertain situations?\
A. Probability reduces the environment to a fully observable one.\
B. The probabilistic agent can compute the **likelihoods** for unobserved aspects (like pits or the wumpus) and find the most likely safe square.\
C. The logical agent must always choose randomly when encountering a pit.\
D. The probabilistic agent does not suffer from the logical qualification problem.
