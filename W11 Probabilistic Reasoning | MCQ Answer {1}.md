**1. Correct Answer: C**
"Uncertainty arises because of both **laziness and ignorance**."

**2. Correct Answer: C**
"In probability theory, the set of all possible worlds is called the **sample space**."

**3. Correct Answer: C**
"Technically speaking, a rational utility-based agent chooses the action that maximizes the **expected utility** of the action outcomes".

**4. Correct Answer: C**
"It does not scale well, however: for a domain described by $n$ Boolean variables, it requires an input table of size $O(2^n)$ and takes $O(2^n)$ time to process the table."

**5. Correct Answer: C**
"A common task is extracting the **marginal probability** of a subset of variables by summing entries over the remaining variables."

**6. Correct Answer: C**
"Section 12.4 showed that absolute independence assertions allow a **decomposition of the full joint distribution into much smaller pieces**."

**7. Correct Answer: B**
"Bayes' rule is essential because it allows the computation of unknown diagnostic probabilities (P(cause | effect)) from known causal probabilities (P(effect | cause))."

**8. Correct Answer: B**
"the answer is that probability statements are made with respect to a **knowledge state**, not with respect to the real world."

**9. Correct Answer: C**
"This is the **logical qualification problem** (page 259), for which we so far have seen no real solution."

**10. Correct Answer: C**
"The **Naive Bayes model** assumes that all effect variables are **conditionally independent given a single cause variable**".

**11. Correct Answer: B**
"the rule is often applied using a process that involves calculating the posterior probability for each value of the query variable and then **normalizing** the results."

**12. Correct Answer: B**
"Because Agent 1 has inconsistent beliefs, Agent 2 is able to devise a set of three bets that guarantees a loss for Agent 1, no matter what the outcome of a and b." (This concept is known as a Dutch book.)

**13. Correct Answer: B**
"In this way, the 'global' definition of rationality... is turned into a 'local' constraint on rational-agent designs that can be expressed in a simple program."

**14. Correct Answer: C**
"P(X |e) = $\alpha\text{P}(X ,e) = \alpha\sum_y \text{P}(X ,e,y)$ where the summation is over all possible $y$s (i.e., all possible combinations of values of the **unobserved variables Y**)."

**15. Correct Answer: B**
"Pure logical inference can conclude nothing about which square is most likely to be safe, so a logical agent might have to choose randomly. We will see that a probabilistic agent can do much better than the logical agent." and "A wumpus-world agent can calculate probabilities for unobserved aspects of the world, thereby improving on the decisions of a purely logical agent.".
